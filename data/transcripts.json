      "transcript": "Okay guys today we’re making creamy garlic mushroom pasta. You’ll need 200 grams of pasta, two tablespoons of butter, a tablespoon of olive oil, three cloves of garlic minced, 250 grams of mushrooms sliced, half a cup of heavy cream, half a cup of grated parmesan, salt, pepper, and some fresh parsley. First cook the pasta until it’s al dente. In a pan melt the butter with the olive oil and add the garlic. Once that’s fragrant throw in the mushrooms and cook them until they’re golden. Now pour in the cream, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Add in the parmesan and let it melt. Finally toss in the pasta and coat everything together. And that’s it, creamy garlic mushroom pasta in under twenty minutes."

      "transcript": "Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt it. I’m using penne pasta but any shape works. Heat some olive oil in a pan and add diced onion. Cook that down until soft. Now grate in two zucchinis and cook them until they shrink and get golden. Pour in half a cup of cream and add a good handful of parmesan cheese. Stir that together until it’s silky. Drain the pasta, save a little of the cooking water, and toss it all together. Finish with lemon zest on top. That’s zucchini cream pasta."

      "transcript": "I was craving something fresh so I’m making my avocado toast upgrade. Mash one ripe avocado with a squeeze of lemon juice, a little salt, and chili flakes. While that’s happening fry an egg sunny side up. Spread the avocado mix on toast, put the egg on top, and then drizzle with hot honey. Crunchy, creamy, spicy, sweet — breakfast is never boring."
